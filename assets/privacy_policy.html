    <h1>Privacy Policy for Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network's application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information in a safe, secure, and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices for both online and offline data.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>During the registration process, we collect personal and sensitive data such as your name, email, affiliation, gender, race/ethnicity, city/state/country of residence, birth date, and how you discovered our organization. We use your email for account management, service updates, and communication. The demographic information collected helps us better understand user trends and improve our services.</p>

    <h2>Chat Page Participation</h2>
    <p>Our chat page allows users to comment and engage in discussions. When you post a comment, your name and avatar will be displayed alongside your comment to identify you to other users. Please be aware that any information you choose to disclose in these areas becomes public, and you should exercise caution when deciding to share any personal details.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored indefinitely unless you choose to delete your account, at which point all your personal data is erased from our systems. We employ Firebase for secure encryption and management of all data, including passwords. In addition to Firebase, we implement further security measures to protect your data. These measures are reviewed and updated regularly to ensure your data remains secure.</p>
    
    <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>Our app uses Firebase for push notifications and tracks the number of notifications opened across the platform. Push notifications are used to improve user engagement and keep users updated about important events or changes. You can manage your push notification preferences and choose to deactivate these notifications at any time via the app settings.</p>

    <h2>User Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, modify, or delete your personal data at any time. During the sign-up process, you can also opt-out of providing certain data. If you want to access, modify, or delete your personal data, you can do so by contacting us at the email provided below.</p>

    <h2>Policy for Children</h2>
    <p>Our application is not designed for children under the age of 13, and we do not intentionally collect or maintain personal data about anyone under the age of 13.</p>
